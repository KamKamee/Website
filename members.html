                        <pGreetings! I'm Rhianne F. Ramos. 

I was born on April 24, 2007 at Jecson Medical Center in Tarlac. I am also the eldest among the two children of Mr. and Mrs. Ramos. Both of our parents work as OFWs. So, I grew up with my grandparents in Gerona, Tarlac, for 14 years until my mother came home. 

I attended junior high school in GJC and graduated from LCNHS-MMCA. Moreover, I am currently an 11th grade STEM student at Talipan National High School. I am a regular student and a member of the math club and stem club. I am also attending a Japanese class online. 

My goal is to become a successful person in the future as a civil engineer. I cook and draw occasionally, so I might as well consider being a cook and an architect.
